# London Bike Sharing Project

### Project Overview
In this project, I've harnessed the power of Python and Tableau to dive deep into the world of London's bike-sharing system. By extracting, transforming, and analyzing the dataset, I've uncovered valuable insights and crafted compelling visualizations that shed light on the city's dynamic bike usage patterns.
### Data Sources
London Bike Sharing Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "london_merged.csv" file, containing historical data on bike sharing in London from Kaggle.com.
